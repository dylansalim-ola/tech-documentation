# Code Documentation Implementations
## Aim: 
To ease the onboarding process of a new frontend developer into veeka-app, from setup to productions. This documentation should be minimal, short and concise. The complex documentation should be included in the wiki/bookstack.

### Stakeholder
- All client engineers (especially for new client engineers onboarding)
## Todo: 
Rewrite the README.md to acts as an easy setup documentation for newcomers to refer

## Details of Todo(Frontend):
[ ] - Project Setup Guide (Apply flutter.diff, hammer in VSCode)
[ ] - Include script to generate @JsonSerializable g.dart, store g.dart, proto twirp.dart file
[ ] - Include guides/links to technologies we used, eg. mobx, how to crowdin, how to push assets to oss etc
[ ] - Include recommended ways to doing things in this codebase, eg. communication between different subproject
[ ] - Brief explanation on how our code base is structured, can use a diagram to illustrate it 
[ ] - Business logic specific details should not cover in this README.md
